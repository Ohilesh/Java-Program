declare 7 data types in instance variable.
then create a void instance method inside which create a parametersized variable declaring all the seven datatypes.
now create a instance method returning one data type from the above parameturized variables.
similarly create six other instance methods for every other data type in parameteurized varaiable.
now create a instance of the previously created class in an other runner class by giving the keyword new.
after this call all the methods that has been declared in the previous class in this runner class. 
now you should execute the runner class as the main method is been written in the runner class.
